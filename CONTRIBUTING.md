# Contributing to webcomponents.org

webcomponents.org is being rebuilt based on efforts of the [Web Components Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webcomponents/), including:
* A new catalog based on the [Custom Elements Manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest) format.
* Content from [community docs and guides](https://github.com/webcomponents-cg/docs-and-guides)

It is undergoing active and disruptive development at the moment. Useful contributing guidelines are forthcoming.
